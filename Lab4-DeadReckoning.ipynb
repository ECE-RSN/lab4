    "# EECE 5554 Lab 4: Introduction to Dead Reckoning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Lab 4 introduces the principles of dead reckoning using walking data. This lab will demonstrate why dead reckoning is a hard problem! Please note that we do not expect you to have beautiful results-- the goal here is to learn the strengths and weaknesses of dead reckoning and IMU data before you try it in NUance for Lab 5!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals and Objectives\n",
    "We would like to understand the outputs from the VectorNav IMU magnetometer, gyroscope, and accelerometer during walking. We will attempt to use these data to reconstruct a walking path. \n",
    "\n",
    "### By the end of this lab, we expect that a well-prepared student will be able to:\n",
    "- Calculate a calibration from magnetometer data using least squares\n",
    "- Plot gyro and accelerometer data and time integrals of these data\n",
    "- Reason about sources of non-idealities and error in data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration Policy for this Lab\n",
    "- Everyone in the team needs to generate their own figures \n",
    "- Data will be collected as a group\n",

    "- One teammate should hold the IMU, one should hold the laptop, and one should record a video while you are walking. \n",
    "- Try to hold the IMU in the same position relative to the laptop and watch the cable length.\n",
    "- Begin recording a ROSbag.\n",
    "- Walk in a circle at constant pace for 3-5 revolutions, picking a landmark to revolve around (like a rock, tree, etc).\n",

    "- Try to face in a cardinal direction (N, E, S, W) and make a precise 90 degree turn. \n",

    "Once you have completed the datasets, share the .bag and video among the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis: Using the ROSbag data, your video, and your knowledge of the area:\n",
    "- Plot the X vs. Y components of magnetic field and apply calibration to your dataset. Plot two sub-figs before and after calibration (Fig. 1)\n",
    "- Plot rotational rate and total rotation (integrate once) on two subplots vs. time on all three axes (Fig. 2-4)\n",
    "- Plot acceleration, velocity (integrate once), and displacement (integrate twice) vs. time as three subplots on all three axes (Fig. 5-7)\n",
    "- Repeat analyses above with the square dataset, using the calibration from your circle dataset. You do not need to re-calibrate. (Fig. 8-14)\n",
    "- Make a short statement about whether your results \"make sense\" given the ground truth recording of your video.\n",
